# Introduction

### Welcome

Thank you for considering contributing to Active Admin. It's people like you that make Active Admin such a great tool.

### Background

Following these guidelines helps the maintainers of this open source project in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Contributions we ARE looking for

Improving documentation, writing expert content, providing examples, and submitting issues are all examples of helpful contributions that help our community provide best-in-class resourcesâ€”*for our community*.

### Contributions we are NOT looking for

At this point, we will not accept contributions that are branded or self-serving the author of the contribution.  This does not mean that helpful products and services cannot be referenced, but it does mean we reserve the right to deny any contributions that are blatantly self-promoting.

# Ground Rules

### Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Do not add any additional categories/pillars unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using the existing ontology.
* Keep versions as small as possible, preferably one new enhancement/content per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Identifying Your First Contribution

Unsure how to contribute? You can start by looking through the help-wanted issues:
* Help wanted issues - issues which, if completed, would make a significant impact to the community.

### Resources
* Here are a couple of friendly tutorials on how to use GitHub to contribute: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/
* Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

# Getting started
### Committing Your First Contribution

**NOTE:** Please sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with The Mitten Project before submitting your contribution

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix that can be addressed within the Github user interface:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the contributing guide for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with The Mitten Project.
    * Note the The Mitten Project Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

# How to report corrections
### Security
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email info@themittenproject.com instead.

### Corrections
When suggesting a correction, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version are you referring to?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest an enhancement
To provide ideas for enhancements to the project, please answer the following:

1. What is the idea/item (no more than a few sentences)?
2. Who is it important to?
3. Why is it important to them?
4. How could we measure the success/impact of the item after it is made available? 

If you find the enhancement doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. There are more than likely others with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which answers the above questions.

### Review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
